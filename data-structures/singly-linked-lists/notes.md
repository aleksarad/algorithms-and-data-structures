# Singly Linked Lists #

## What is a linked list? ##
* a list with no indeces, where each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.
* each node only points in ONE direction (a double linked list points in two)
* contains head, tail, and length.

## BIG O ##
* insertion - O(1). much faster than array
* removal - depends -> O(1) or O(n)
* searching - O(n)
* access - O(n)
