# Problem Solving Patterns #

* Understand the problem
    * Restate the problem in your own words
    * What are the inputs and outputs?
    * Can the output be determined from the input? Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
    * What are the important pieces of data?
* Explore concrete examples
    * Start with simple examples, then progress to more complex
    * Explore edge cases - what if input is empty or invalid
* Break it down
    * Explicitly write out the steps you need to take 
* Solve/Simplify
    * Solve if you can, or simplify. If there's a particularly challenging piece of a problem, solve a simpler version of it.
* Refactor
    * Talk through potential issues and improvements
    * Can you check the result?
    * Can you derive the result differently?
    * Can you use the result or method for soem other problem?
    * Can you improve the performance?
