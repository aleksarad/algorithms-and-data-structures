# Problem Solving Patterns #

* Frequency Counter
    * Uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can avoid the need for nested loops.
* Multiple Pointers
    * Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain conditions.
* Sliding Window
    * Creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window increases or closes.
* Divide and Conquer
    * Dividing a data set into smaller chunks and repeating a process with a subset of data
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms 
* Backtracking
