A function that calls itself.
* JSON.parse
* DOM traversal
* Object traversal
* complex data structures

## Recursion and the Call Stack ##
* an invoked function is moved to the top of the call stack, and removed when the function ends or JS sees the return keyword.
* recursive functions keep calling themselves, which is why we need a stopping point

## Parts of a Recursive Function ##
* base case - condition when the recursion ends
* different inputs

## Helper Method Recursion ##
* Outer and inner function, inner or helper is recursive.

## Pure Recursion Tips ##
* For arrays, use methods like slice,
